# REST Discussion Questions

With your table choose a *resource* that your server contains data about. A resource will be something like 'books', 'users', 'episodes', or 'characters', something that your users will be perfoming CRUD actions on.

Your task is to write out the 7 RESTful routes that correspond to the 4 CRUD actions.  Be sure to include the HTTP verb, the name of the route and the corresponding CRUD action.  What SQL (if applicable) would be fired in the controller actions for each of the routes.

Why might it be important that routes and resources have a coneventional structure?
